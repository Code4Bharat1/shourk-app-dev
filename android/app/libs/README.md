# Zoom Video SDK Setup Instructions

## ✅ Current Status: REAL BACKEND INTEGRATION
- ✅ Real backend API integration (no mock data)
- ✅ Real Zoom Video SDK integration with proper credentials
- ✅ Real session management and controls
- ✅ Real camera and microphone functionality
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Responsive UI design

## 🔧 What's Working Now:
The app now uses **real backend APIs** and **real Zoom Video SDK** that:
- Fetches real session data from your backend at `192.168.0.126:5070`
- Uses real Zoom SDK credentials from your .env file
- Joins real Zoom video sessions
- Controls actual camera and microphone
- Handles session lifecycle properly
- Provides real-time video/audio functionality
- Shows proper error messages for connection issues

## 🚀 For Your Teammate - Quick Setup:

### 1. Pull Latest Changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Clean and Build
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d android
```

### 3. Test the App
- Navigate to video call pages
- Test mic/camera toggles (real functionality)
- Check that camera actually opens/closes
- Verify microphone works
- Check that session data loads from backend

## 📱 Current Features Working:
- ✅ Real backend API integration
- ✅ Expert session call page with real data
- ✅ User session call page with real data
- ✅ Real-time join detection (polling)
- ✅ Responsive UI design
- ✅ Real camera and microphone controls
- ✅ Session lifecycle management
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Proper authentication with JWT tokens

## 🔄 Real Implementation Details:

### Backend Integration:
- Uses your laptop's IP: `192.168.0.126:5070`
- Real API calls to `/api/experttoexpertsession` and `/api/usertoexpertsession`
- Proper JWT authentication
- Real session data fetching
- Real Zoom token generation

### Camera Functionality:
- Real camera permission handling
- Actual camera start/stop via Zoom SDK
- Real video stream management

### Microphone Functionality:
- Real microphone permission handling
- Actual mute/unmute via Zoom SDK
- Real audio stream management

### Session Management:
- Real Zoom session join/leave
- Proper session lifecycle
- Real-time participant management

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:
- If you get build errors, check that Zoom SDK AAR is properly included
- If you get connection errors, make sure backend is running on `192.168.0.126:5070`
- If you get authentication errors, make sure you're logged in with valid JWT token
- Check console logs for "ZoomSDK" and "🔍" messages for debugging
- Verify camera/microphone permissions are granted

## ✅ Verification:
The setup is working when:
1. App builds successfully on Android
2. Video call pages load without errors
3. Session data loads from backend (no more "loading..." forever)
4. Camera actually opens when toggled
5. Microphone actually works when toggled
6. Real Zoom sessions can be joined
7. No more "Socket issue or timeout" errors

## 📝 Important Notes:
- **REQUIRED**: Backend must be running on `192.168.0.126:5070`
- **REQUIRED**: User must be logged in with valid JWT token
- Real backend integration is now complete
- No mock implementation - everything is real
- Camera and microphone now actually work
- All API calls go to your real backend

## 🔧 Backend Requirements:
Make sure your backend is running:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/backend
npm run dev
# or
node server.js
```

The backend should be accessible at: `http://192.168.0.126:5070`

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: "Connection refused" or "Socket timeout"
**Solution**: Make sure your backend is running on port 5070

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution**: Make sure user is logged in with valid JWT token

### Issue: "Session not found"
**Solution**: Check that the session ID is valid and exists in database

### Issue: Camera/Mic not working
**Solution**: Grant camera and microphone permissions in Android settings
